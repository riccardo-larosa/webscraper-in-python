This is useful, for example, if you have a product like a T-shirt that can be personalized or you sell greetings cards that can be printed with your shoppers personalized messages. You can do this using the custom_inputs attribute.Configure the custom_inputs attribute when you create a product.{
  "data": {
    "type": "product",
    "attributes": {
    /*** other product attributes ommitted ***/
    "custom_inputs": {
              "input": {
                  "name": "Input",
                  "validation_rules": [
                      {
                          "type": "string",
                          "options": {
                              "max_length": 50
                          }
                      }
                  ],
                  "required": false
              }
          }
      }
  }
}
When configuring the custom_inputs attribute:You can rename input to something more representative of the input that shoppers are adding, for example, message or front.name is the name that is displayed in your storefront.You can add validation rules. For example, the input field must be a string and/or up to 255 characters in length. The limit is 255 characters.For example, you may sell T-shirts that can have personalized text on the front and back of the shirt.{
  "data": {
    "type": "product",
    "attributes": {
    /*** other product attributes ommitted ***/
    "custom_inputs": {
        "front": {
          "name": "T-Shirt Front",
          "validation_rules": [
            {
              "type": "string",
              "options": {
                "max_length": 50
              }
            }
          ],
          "required": false
        },
        "back": {
          "name": "T-Shirt Back",
          "validation_rules": [
            {
              "type": "string",
              "options": {
                "max_length": 50
              }
            }
          ],
          "required": false
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
Once you have configured your custom inputs on a product, you must configure the custom inputs in your orders. See adding your products to carts. When the product is added to the cart, those custom inputs are supplied.{
  "data": {
    "type": "cart_item",
    "attributes": {
    /*** other product attributes ommitted ***/
    "custom_inputs": {
        "T-Shirt Front": "Jane",
        "T_Shirt Back": "Jane Doe's Dance Academy"
        }
      }
   }
}
If the same product has different custom_inputs attributes, then these are added as separate items in a cart.The custom_inputs attribute is stored in the cart item and must not exceed 1MB. When a cart is checked out, the custom_inputs attribute becomes part of the order.When you add products to a cart with custom_inputs, there are certain limitations on usage of the custom_inputs with the following promotion types:For Free Gift Promotions, you can add custom_inputs to gift items.For Fixed Bundle Discount Promotions, the promotion applies as long as the cart contains the bundle SKUs even when there are different custom_inputs.For X for Y Discount Promotion and X for amount discount promotion, the promotion applies when there are two SKUs with the same custom_inputs. The promotion does not apply when there are different custom_inputs and the SKUs are in different line items.Related ResourcesLocalesCatalogsPrice BooksProducts APIWas this helpful?UselessNoYesAmazingPrevious←Delete a ProductNextAssign Products to Multiple Nodes→Page contentsRelated Resources
