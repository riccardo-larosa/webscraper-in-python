As a merchandiser, you want to be able to present all the options you have available for your products to make it easier for your shoppers to visualize them and influence a potential sale. Product Variations allow you to create and manage up to 10,000 unique combinations of options for variations of a product. You can then use PXM Catalogs to build different catalogs for different users, giving you greater flexibility with your product data and making it easier for your shoppers to interact with your products.For example, a product has two variations size and color. The size variation has three options, such as small, medium, and large and the color variation has three options, such as green, red, and blue. This creates a variation matrix with nine possible unique combinations or child products as shown in the following example:You can create additional variations or options and attach them to a product to increase the number of combinations. Using the previous example, if you add a third variation with three options, you can build child products with 27 unique combinations of variations and options.ReusabilityVariations are reusable, and you can attach the same variation to any number of products. You can also create a link between the existing variation and a new product. The following scenario provides an example:Create a variation shoe size and add five options in the variation.Create a product shoe 1 and link the variation shoe size to the product.Create second product, shoe 2 and link the variation shoe size to this product as well.Create a third product shoe 3 and do not link any variation to this product.shoe 1 and shoe 2 inherit the properties of shoe size variation, and you can build the child products with the options. However, you cannot build child products for shoe 3 unless you assign a variation with at-least one option to the product.Selecting Variation Options When Building Child ProductsWhen building your child products, you can choose to exclude or include certain combinations of variation options. This is useful, for example, if you have a variation option that you do not sell. This makes managing and building your child products quick and easy.For more information, see Building Child Products Using Variations.Product ModifiersUse modifiers to change the properties of child products that are inherited from a base product. With modifiers, you only need to have one base product with a variation attached to the product.Modifiers attached to a variation option are applied to a base product to create child products. For example, instead of creating three base products for three different shirt colors, you can do the following:Create a base product, shirt, with the variation, color, attached to it.Create three options for the color variation.Create a modifier for each option to change the properties of each child product. For example, attach a description append modifier to each option so that each child product has different description based on the color of the child product.Build the child products.This screenshot provides an example of a child product of shirt which has a specific description associated with it because of the description append modifier setting for the option yellow:Price ModifiersYou can use price modifiers to change the price property of child products. By default, child products inherit the same price as their base products. Using price modifiers, you can enable child products to inherit a different price. This enables you to configure the price of child products, for example, to be lower than its base product, without having to individually update the price of your child products. There are three types of price modifier.ModifierData TypeEffectprice_incrementstringIncreases the price of a product.price_decrementstringDecreases the price of a product.price_equalsstringSets the price of a product to the amount you specify.The following is an overview of the steps you need to follow to use price modifiers.Create a price modifier. You must give the price modifier a unique name, for example, tax_modifier. For more information, see Create a Price ModifierCreate a product modifier that uses the same name as the price modifier.
